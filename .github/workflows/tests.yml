Here is the GitHub Actions workflow that meets the requirements:
```
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  playwright-tests:
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Playwright
        uses: playwright/actions/setup-playwright@v2
        with:
          browsers: chromium, firefox, webkit

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
        working-directory: tests

      - name: Generate reports
        run: npm run report
        working-directory: tests

      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: test-reports
          path: tests/reports
```
Note that this workflow assumes you have a `package.json` file with scripts for running tests and generating reports. You may need to adjust the workflow to fit your specific use case.
